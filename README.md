# opencity3d

This project aims to provide a common standard for designing and sharing 3D models of cities that can be assembled with the aid of 3D printers. This standard specifies a grid format as well as compatible adapters for buildings, lots, and various tile-based infrastructure.

The main objectives of this project are:

- To promote the use of 3D printing as a tool for enthusiasts and amateur hobbyists, with potential applications in urban planning, design, education, and research.
- To foster collaboration and exchange among researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts who are interested in 3D printing of cities.
- To encourage the adoption of a standard format for 3d printing cities, thereby promoting reusability and interoperability in the craft.

## How to use the standard

The standard consists of two main components: a collection of base asset and printer configuration files, and a wiki guide to city modeling and printing.

- The base assets serve as connectors and adapters for city modeling components. Printer configuration files are also provided as a starting point for printing.
- The wiki guide documents considerations and lessons learned in city modeling and printing.

To use the standard, you need designs to print. You can either create your own files from scratch or use existing ones from public and/or private source. Choose appropriate adapters to fit the designs at scale. Next, prepare the files for 3D printing using any 3D modeling software and any printer (results may vary depending on the specifications of each printer).

## How to contribute to the project
