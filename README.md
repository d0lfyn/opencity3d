# opencity3d

This project provides a standard for creating, sharing, and printing modular 3D models of urban environments. It encompasses considerations of scale, physical connectors, and best practices.

## Objectives

- **Build a platform**, by facilitating reuse and interoperability in the design and printing of hobby kits.
- **Nurture a community**, by enabling collaboration and exchange among those interested in 3D printing cities.
- **Craft cities**, by using 3D technologies to bring concepts into reality.

## How to use the standard

The standard consists of printable connectors that are documented in the wiki knowledge base.

- Printable connectors can be found in /bases. Currently, these are the only files that are open-sourced. Other components may be released, once tolerances have been tested.
- The wiki knowledge base documents the standards project.

To use the standard, you need designs to print, as well as access to a 3D printer. You can either create your own files from scratch or use existing ones from public and/or private source. Given that you have a design on hand:

1. Scale the design appropriately.
2. From /bases, choose an appropriately-sized base for your scaled designs, and in your choice of 3d modeling software, merge the respective mesh underneath the design.
3. Prepare the file for 3D printing using any 3D printing software.
4. Print.
5. Connect the printed product to an OC3D grid, using the appropriate OC3D adapter.

Detailed instructions can be found in [the wiki](https://github.com/d0lfyn/opencity3d/wiki/How-to-use-the-oc3d-standard-(illustrated-guide)).

## How to contribute to the project

This project is open-source and welcomes contributions from anyone who is interested in 3D printing cities. There are several ways you can contribute to the project:

- You can report issues or suggest enhancements on the GitHub issue tracker.
- You can join the community chat with feedback, questions, gallery submissions, printer configurations, &c. on the GitHub Discussions forum.
